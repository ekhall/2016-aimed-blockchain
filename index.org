* What is health data?
[[./resources/paperrecords.jpg]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: No. Accessible: No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the past, health data for good reason used to be isolated to physical paper charts in a doctor's office. Minimally networked.
#+END_NOTES

* We moved to EHRs...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: Yes. Accessible: Still No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done nothing for interoperability and accessibility. Most of these database schema are _very_ complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.  
#+END_NOTES

* Mobile Health 
Our next problem.

[[./resources/med-personal-data.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We are experiencing an explosion from below in personal health devices. These obviously aren't home xrays but they are HR, BP, in some cases lab values like glucose. This erosion from below has occured in other fields as well.
#+END_NOTES

* Unfulfilled Digital Promise 
The promise of digital data is more than this.

It's greater than isolated medical records on a hard disk.

The promise is accessibility and interoperability.

* Current Data Sharing 'Solutions'

1. Hospital / Practice EHRs
2. Patient "Portable" e.g. USB drives.
3. "Independent" Third Party Cloud Services

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. Not really working, data shared as PDFs.
2. Bifurcates data, hard to keep sync.
3. Hard to argue data is really free, just abstracted another level.
4. None answer the question of personal health device data.
#+END_NOTES

* Blockchains
A shared, distributed, immutable ledger for transactional data that establishes accountability and transparency.

* Blockchain Qualities
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Ledger: Think Excel Spreadsheet
2. Shared: Accepts input from multiple sources.
3. Distributed: Data shared with all ("single copy"), accepts data from many
4. Immutable: Once a "consensus" is agreed, data is unchangeable.
