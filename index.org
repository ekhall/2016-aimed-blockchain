** What is health data?
[[./resources/paperrecords.jpg]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: No. Accessible: No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the past, health data for good emacs span multiple columnsreason used to be isolated to physical paper charts in a doctor's office. Minimally networked.
#+END_NOTES

** We moved to EHRs...
[[./resources/uml.png]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: Yes. Accessible: Still No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done nothing for interoperability and accessibility. Most of these database schema are _very_ complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.  
#+END_NOTES

** Mobile Health 
Our next problem.

[[./resources/med-personal-data.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We are experiencing an explosion from below in personal health devices. These obviously aren't home xrays but they are HR, BP, in some cases lab values like glucose. This erosion from below has occured in other fields as well.
#+END_NOTES

** Unfulfilled Digital Promise 
The promise of digital data is more than this.

It's greater than isolated medical records on a hard disk.

The promise is accessibility and interoperability. Our data should work for us; our patients' data should work for them.

** Current Data Sharing 'Solutions'

- Hospital / Practice EHRs
- Patient "Portable" e.g. USB drives.
- "Independent" Third Party Cloud Services

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Not really working, data shared as PDFs.
- Bifurcates data, hard to keep sync.
- Hard to argue data is really free, just abstracted another level.
- None answer the question of personal health device data.
#+END_NOTES

** Problems: Accessibility
Need your records? Submit a request. Then maybe get a printout of them. 

"MyChart"

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Some EHRs offer patient portals, EPIC has MyChart. Just enough functionality to check a marketing box. Generally can't export it or manage it well. And if you export it and it gets updated? Two copies again.
#+END_NOTES 

** Problems: Interoperability
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Can data be used effectively by all parties?
- Can data _be used as a tool_ itself?

** Problems: Trust
- Old world transactions required in-person meetings.
- Today's digital transactions require third parties.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. If everyone created his/her own records of transactions he/she witnessed, would be multiple versions and conflicting transactions would cause split in what was true.
2. Traditionally this is solved via trusted third parties. Trusted third parties in the online world still allow impersonation, data corruption.
3. Blockchains solve this differently. Consensus.
#+END_NOTES 

** Ideal Goals
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Patients' records should be consistent and available across institutional boundaries.
- Access should be strictly determined by the patient him/herself.
- When shared, all parties should be able to understand the data with a goal of increasing healthcare quality.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Without assurances to accuracy, privacy, and security nodes will not have incentive to share.
#+END_NOTES

** Blockchains
A shared, distributed, immutable ledger for transactional data that establishes accountability and transparency.

On Distributed Communications, Paul Baran 1964

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Began with Bitcoin
#+END_NOTES

** Blockchain Qualities (1/2)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A Blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger.
- Composed of "Blocks" which are time-similar collections of transactions.
- Blocks are immutable, integrity verified - each block contains a cryptographic hash.
- Hash of a block in the chain is dependent on the prior block. Chain is immutable.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. I have the ledger, you have the ledger. There is no second conflicting copy.
4. Because the hash of any incorporated block is based on the prior block, the chain is immutable. 
#+END_NOTES 

** Blockchain (image)
[[./resources/blocks-in-chain.png]]

** Blockain Qualities (2/2)
- A blockchain does not depend on a trusted central authority like a bank or hospital EHR.
- Instead the blockchain is distributed to all nodes which participate in the network.
- Because no central authority validates the blockchain, a network consensus must be reached.

** Improvement: Accessibility


** Improvement: Interoperability
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Patients are seen at multiple institutions. In their points of view, their records are a sequential series of events irrespective of location. 
2. Furthermore: later events can be based on earlier ones. A bad PFT might lead to prescription of an inhaler - and its prescription is _dependent_ on the first event.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
2. Not broadly possible today.
#+END_NOTES 


** Improvement: Trust
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)


** Consensus

** Summary
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We have not achieved the true value of digital health data. 
- There is currently no single canonical data ledger.
- Data is hidden from owners inside EHRs; owners do no effectively own their own health data.
- Data owners are not the arbiters of data access.
- 
- Blockchains answer all of these limitations.
