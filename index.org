* What is health data?
[[./resources/paperrecords.jpg]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: No. Accessible: No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the past, health data for good reason used to be isolated to physical paper charts in a doctor's office. Minimally networked.
#+END_NOTES

* We moved to EHRs...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Digital: Yes. Accessible: Still No

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done nothing for interoperability and accessibility. Most of these database schema are _very_ complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.  
#+END_NOTES

* Mobile Health 
Our next problem.

[[./resources/med-personal-data.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We are experiencing an explosion from below in personal health devices. These obviously aren't home xrays but they are HR, BP, in some cases lab values like glucose. This erosion from below has occured in other fields as well.
#+END_NOTES

* Unfulfilled Digital Promise 
The promise of digital data is more than this.

It's greater than isolated medical records on a hard disk.

The promise is accessibility and interoperability.

* Current Data Sharing 'Solutions'

1. Hospital / Practice EHRs
2. Patient "Portable" e.g. USB drives.
3. "Independent" Third Party Cloud Services

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. Not really working, data shared as PDFs.
2. Bifurcates data, hard to keep sync.
3. Hard to argue data is really free, just abstracted another level.
4. None answer the question of personal health device data.
#+END_NOTES

* Problems: Accessibility
Need your records? Submit a request. Then maybe get a printout of them. 

"MyChart"

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Some EHRs offer patient portals, EPIC has MyChart. Just enough functionality to mark a marketing box. Generally can't export it or manage it well. And if you export it and it gets updated? Two copies again.
#+END_NOTES 

* Problems: Interoperability
Can data be used effectively?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Hand in hand with Accessibility: can we use this data effectively between applications or health care providers? Can I contribute personal health data to my own record?
#+END_NOTES 

* Problems: Trust
- Old world transactions required in-person meetings.
- Today's digital transactions require third parties.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
1. If everyone created his/her own records of transactions he/she witnessed, would be multiple versions and conflicting transactions would cause split in what was true.
2. Traditionally this is solved via trusted third parties.
3. Blockchains solve this differently. Consensus.
#+END_NOTES 

* Consensus

* Blockchains
A shared, distributed, immutable ledger for transactional data that establishes accountability and transparency.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Began with Bitcoin
#+END_NOTES

* Blockchain Qualities
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Ledger: Think Spreadsheet
2. Shared: Accepts input from multiple sources.
3. Distributed: Data shared with all ("single copy"), accepts data from many
4. Immutable: Once a "consensus" is agreed, data is unchangeable.
