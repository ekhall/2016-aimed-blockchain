<ul>
<li>We must reinvent healthcare to <span class="underline">be preventative</span>.</li>
<li><b>Current state of art:</b> Take point measurement (particularly if symptomatic) and compare to some clinical study (often from some time ago) on a "representative population".</li>
<li>If outside a threshold, some decision is made.</li>
<li>This is what sensitivity and specificity are based on.</li>

<h3 id="org03e0c06">Representative Population</h3>
<ul>
<li>A flawed idea.</li>
<li>Doesn't fit with the idea that we all have this "unique" genetic code.</li>
<li>And while genomics is important, we know twins vary in phenotypes: more encoded into our physiologic states than simple genomics.</li>

Digital: Yes. Accessible: Still No
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done nothing for interoperability and accessibility. Most of these database schema are <span class="underline">very</span> complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.

We are experiencing an explosion from below in personal health devices. These obviously aren't home xrays but they are HR, BP, in some cases lab values like glucose. This erosion from below has occured in other fields as well.

<p>
The promise of digital data is more than this.
</p>

<p>
It's greater than isolated medical records on a hard disk.
</p>

<p>
The <b>promise is accessibility and interoperability</b>. Our data should work for us; our patients' data should work for them.

Need your records? Submit a request. Then maybe get a printout of them.

"MyChart"

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Some EHRs offer patient portals, EPIC has MyChart. Just enough functionality to check a marketing box. Generally can't export it or manage it well. And if you export it and it gets updated? Two copies again.

<ul>
<li>Old world transactions required in-person meetings.</li>
<li>Today's digital transactions require third parties.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>If everyone created his/her own records of transactions he/she witnessed, would be multiple versions and conflicting transactions would cause split in what was true.</li>
<li>Traditionally this is solved via trusted third parties. Trusted third parties in the online world still allow impersonation, data corruption.</li>
<li>Blockchains solve this differently. Consensus.</li>

<li class="fragment appear">Patients' records should be consistent and available across institutional boundaries.</li>

<h3 id="org29bd7fb">Blockchain Qualities (1/2)</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">A Blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Composed of "Blocks" which are time-similar collections of transactions.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Blocks are immutable, integrity verified - each block contains a cryptographic hash.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Hash of a block in the chain is dependent on the prior block. Chain is immutable.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>I have the ledger, you have the ledger. There is no second conflicting copy.</li>
<li>Because the hash of any incorporated block is based on the prior block, the chain is immutable.</li>

<h3 id="org8ac75c6">Blockain Qualities (2/2)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A blockchain does not depend on a trusted central authority like a bank or hospital EHR.</li>
<li>Instead the blockchain is distributed to all nodes which participate in the network.</li>
<li>Because no central authority validates the blockchain, a network consensus must be reached.</li>

<h3 id="org6be15b9">Improvement: Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blockchains promise to free our data from single data silos.</li>
<li>In an environment of tailored <b>personal</b> health data, blockchains allow much larger time-series of data and - with data tailored to us - can reduce the false positives on per-patient data.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>Not unique to blockchains, but the first to effectively and forseeably offer this at this scale - because it <b>massively increases accessibility across time and between institutions</b>.</li>

<li class="fragment appear">Patients are seen at multiple institutions. In their points of view, their records are a sequential series of events irrespective of location.</li>
