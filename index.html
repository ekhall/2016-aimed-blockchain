<li>If outside a threshold, some decision is made.</li>
<li>This is what sensitivity and specificity are based on.</li>

<li>A flawed idea.</li>

Digital: Yes. Accessible: Still No

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done really very little for interoperability and accessibility. Too, most of these database schema are <span class="underline">very</span> complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.

We are experiencing an explosion from below in personal health devices. These obviously aren't home xrays but they are HR, BP, in some cases lab values like glucose. This erosion from below has occured in other fields as well.

<h3 id="org8a100b4">Unfulfilled Digital Promise</h3>
<p>
The promise of digital data is more than this.
</p>

<p>
It's greater than isolated medical records on a hard disk.
</p>

<p>
The <b>promise is accessibility and interoperability</b>. Our data should work for us; our patients' data should work for them.
</p>

<p>
And no preventable disease should lead to death.

<p>
Some EHRs offer patient portals, EPIC has MyChart. Just enough functionality to check a marketing box. Generally can't export it or manage it well. And if you export it and it gets updated? Two copies again.

<h3 id="orgc3055e4">Problems: Trust</h3>
<ul>
<li>Old world transactions required in-person meetings.</li>
<li>Today's digital transactions require third parties.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>If everyone created his/her own records of transactions he/she witnessed, would be multiple versions and conflicting transactions would cause split in what was true.</li>
<li>Traditionally this is solved via trusted third parties. Trusted third parties in the online world still allow impersonation, data corruption.</li>
<li>Blockchains solve this differently. Consensus.</li>

<h3 id="org92a760c">Ideal Goals</h3>

<li class="fragment appear">Patients' records should be consistent and available across institutional boundaries.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Access should be strictly determined by the patient him/herself.</li>

<h3 id="orgbe6dfed">Blockchain Qualities (1/2)</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">A Blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Composed of "Blocks" which are time-similar collections of transactions.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Blocks are immutable, integrity verified - each block contains a cryptographic hash.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Hash of a block in the chain is dependent on the prior block. Chain is immutable.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>I have the ledger, you have the ledger. There is no second conflicting copy.</li>
<li>Because the hash of any incorporated block is based on the prior block, the chain is immutable.</li>

<h3 id="orgc65a641">Blockain Qualities (2/2)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A blockchain does not depend on a trusted central authority like a bank or hospital EHR.</li>
<li>Instead the blockchain is distributed to all nodes which participate in the network.</li>
<li>Because no central authority validates the blockchain, a network consensus must be reached.</li>

<h3 id="orge864784">Improvement: Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blockchains promise to free our data from single data silos.</li>
<li>In an environment of tailored <b>personal</b> health data, blockchains allow much larger time-series of data and - with data tailored to us - can reduce the false positives on per-patient data.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>Not unique to blockchains, but the first to effectively and forseeably offer this at this scale - because it <b>massively increases accessibility across time and between institutions</b>.</li>
<li>A <b>single, canonical medical record</b> that travels with the patient across institutions.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Patients are seen at multiple institutions. In their points of view, their records are a sequential series of events irrespective of location.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Furthermore: later events can be based on earlier ones. A bad PFT might lead to prescription of an inhaler - and its prescription is <span class="underline">dependent</span> on the first event.</li>

<h3 id="org8df5e67">Improvement: Trust</h3>
<ul>
<li>First, all data is cryptographically secure.</li>
<li>Much like in banks, access is given appropriately as needed.</li>
<li>But more: The chain is immutable, later blocks depend on the accuracy of those earlier.</li>
<li>In sync, distributed data: there is not any single point of failure more important than any other.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5366ae0">
<h3 id="org5366ae0">Consensus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Network consensus is the most subtle aspect of this.</li>
<li>Bitcoin: Proof of Work</li>
<li>Health: "Proof of Interoperability"? (Peterson, et. al)</li>

</ul>

<p>
Interoperability with FHIR Profiles

<p>
Miner election is distributed evenly.

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>In Blockchain: Proof of Work, which is a novel idea where computers solve mathematical puzzles that are hard to achieve, but easy to verify. The puzzles are automatically created at a difficulty based on network compute power to ensure a fixed time for addition of new blocks.</li>

</section>
<section id="slide-org677dce0">
<h3 id="org677dce0">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">We have not achieved the true value of digital health data.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">There is currently no single canonical data ledger.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Data is hidden from owners inside EHRs; owners do no effectively own their own health data.</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Data owners are not the arbiters of data access.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Blockchains answer all of these limitations.
