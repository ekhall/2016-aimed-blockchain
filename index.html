<ul>
<li>We must reinvent healthcare to <span class="underline">be preventative</span>.</li>
<li><b>Current state of art:</b> Take point measurement (particularly if symptomatic) and compare to some clinical study (often from some time ago) on a "representative population".</li>
<li>If outside a threshold, some decision is made.</li>
<li>This is what sensitivity and specificity are based on.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Today we have moved to electronic health records, we have created digital complexity but done really very little for interoperability and accessibility. Too, most of these database schema are <span class="underline">very</span> complex because we have tried to force semi-structured medical data into inflexible relational schema.

<p>
The promise of digital health data is more than this.
</p>

<p>
It's greater than isolated medical records on some hard disk.
</p>

<p>
The <b>promise is accessibility and interoperability</b>. Our data should work for us; our patients' data should work for them.

<p>
And no preventable disease should lead to death.

<ul>
<li>Patients' records should be consistent and available across institutional boundaries.</li>
<li>Access should be strictly determined by the patient him/herself.</li>
<li>When shared, all parties should be able to understand the data with a goal of increasing healthcare quality.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>"Old world"</b>: transactions required in-person meetings.</li>
<li><b>Today</b>: digital transactions "authenticated" by trusted third parties.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>If everyone created his/her own records of transactions he/she witnessed, would be multiple versions and conflicting transactions would cause split in what was true.</li>
<li>Traditionally this is solved via trusted third parties. Trusted third parties in the online world still allow impersonation, data corruption.</li>

<ul>
<li>A Blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger.</li>
<li>Composed of "Blocks" which are time-similar collections of transactions.</li>
<li>Blocks are immutable, integrity verified - each block contains a cryptographic hash.</li>
<li>Hash of a block in the chain is dependent on the prior block. Chain is immutable.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>I have the ledger, you have the ledger. There is no second conflicting copy.</li>
<li>Because the hash of any incorporated block is based on the prior block, the chain is immutable.</li>

<ul>
<li>A blockchain does not depend on a trusted central authority like a bank or hospital EHR.</li>
<li>Instead the blockchain is distributed to all nodes which participate in the network.</li>

<ul>
<li>Blockchains promise to free our data from single data silos.</li>
<li>In an environment of tailored <b>personal</b> health data, blockchains create a single canonical dataset dependent on time, but independent of third parties.</li>
<li>With single, longitudinal time series of very <i>personal</i> data, can reduce personal false positives.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ol>
<li>Not unique to blockchains, but the first to effectively and forseeably offer this at this scale - because it <b>massively increases accessibility across time and between institutions</b>.</li>

<li>Much like in banks, access is awarded appropriately and as needed.</li>

<h2 id="org45f485c">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have not achieved the true value of digital health data.</li>
<li>There is currently no single canonical data ledger.</li>
<li>Data is hidden from owners inside EHRs; owners do no effectively own their own health data.</li>
<li>Data owners are not the arbiters of data access.</li>

<b>It is likely that blockchains can answer these limitations.</b>
